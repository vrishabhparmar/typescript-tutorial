## Introduction to typescript

Typescript is a programming language developed to overcome the shortcomming of Javascipt. Typescipt is a static type language whearas javascript is a dynamic type language. 

        Typescipt is a Javascript with type-checking

Here is the below example we are initializing the variables using dynamic types and static type 

```Javascipt

let num = 10; // Dynamic

int num = 10;

```

Drawback of typescipt is we need to use a typescipt compliler to convert typescript to javascript.
